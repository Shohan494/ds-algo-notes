# ds-algo-notes

- ds is basically various way to store data in memory
- big o is to find out the solution is best or worst
- implementation is important to understand how to apply and why
- runtime in terms of big o analysis for a particular problem

What do learn in order:
1. Data structures
2. Big-O Analysis
3. Algorithms - sorting algorithms, graph-based algorithms, other classic textbook algorithms
4. Problem solve - use a website like LeetCode to practice how to approach and ultimately solve problems
